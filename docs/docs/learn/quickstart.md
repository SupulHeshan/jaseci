# Jac Quickstart

## Python Superset
Jac is a drop-in replacement for Python and supersets Python, much like Typescript supersets Javascript or C++ supersets C. It extends Python's semantics while maintaining full interoperability with the Python ecosystem.
Anything you can build with Python, you can build in Jac, and often more efficiently.
